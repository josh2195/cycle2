## Major: Information Systems

This relates to my major because it is a website based on data storage. It connects to the CCU server and allows users to upload their files to it. It also protects private information like passwords through hashing.

## Purpose

This website is used to store files on a server. Users must first create an account to upload files and view the file list. When uploading a file the user must give it a title and choose what type of file it is from the drop down menu.

The mail goal of this program is to allow users to upload thier files to a safe location.

## Usage

- Open your internet browser
- Navigate to the webiste
- Log in or create a new account
- Upload your file(s)
- View your file(s)
- Log out knowing your files are secure

## Future Development
- Allow users to view/download files. When I tried to add this, the server said I didnt have access to downloading files.
- Link files to specific accounts. 
- Allow users to choose who they want to share files with.

## Dependencies

None that I can think of. Everything is online.
